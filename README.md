**Mapping Global Health Expenditure Trends and the Future: Insights from 192 Countries (2000-2020)**

**Project Description**

This project aims to analyze global health spending across 192 countries over two decades. Using PostGreSQL, a database was created to maintain all health indicators and outcomes data, which was then analyzed using exploratory data analysis (descriptive statistics and correlations) and advanced machine learning methods on Python. The ultimate goal is to provide insights into how spending has changed, and whether they have had positive or negative impacts on specific health outcomes such as life expectancy and mortality rates.

**Data Sources:**
- Global Health Expenditure Database (GHED): https://apps.who.int/nha/database/Home/Index/en
- Global Health Observatory (GHO): https://www.who.int/data/gho 

These are the WHO's public databases, which contain a list of indicators and health outcomes that are easily filterable depending on what you are looking for. 

**Research Questions:**

These research questions were created in order to better understand where and how countries have invested into global healthcare, and whether these trends are subject to change in the forseeable future. 

1. How have global spending trends evolved over the past two decades across countries?
2. What do predictive models reveal on future expenditure patterns?
3. What do future expenditure patterns mean for the future of healthcare?

Note: this project is a WIP and is still ongoing - results will be published as they are completed.
